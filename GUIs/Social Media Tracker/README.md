## Social Media Tracker

A simple GUI that allows you to open 4 different social media webpages as panels within one window. This is based on 
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/el/firefox/addon/tile-tabs/">Tile Tabs extension</a> which is now outdated for both Chrome and Firefox.
Specifying webpages on startup may be added upon request, so it can be used for other websites as well. Opening new tabs is not available
yet (this is meant to be a GUI, not a web browser), but may be added at a later date along with more advanced functionalities.
